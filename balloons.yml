# Balloons configuration file

# Here is an example configuration section for a balloon which will be ignored by the plugin
# 
# In this configuration section, `example` is the balloon's ID.
# In order to give a player the permission to hold this balloon,
# we would give it the `customballoons.balloons.example` permission node

example:

  # `name`
  #
  # The name of the balloon in the GUI (color codes with `&` are supported)
  # Don't forget to escape quotes/apostrophes in order to avoid getting parsing errors (examples below)

  name: 'Example balloon'         # -> Example balloon
  name: 'Rock ''n'' roll'         # -> Rock 'n' Roll
  name: "Rock 'n' roll"           # -> Rock 'n' Roll
  name: "I escape \" quotes"      # -> I escape " quotes
  name: 'I escape '' apostrophes' # -> I escape ' apostrophes


  # `texture-hash`
  #
  # The texture's hash to use for the balloon (frorm textures.minecraft.net)
  # See https://minecraft-heads.com - on a head's page the 'Minecraft-URL' field in the 'Other' section at the bottom

  texture-hash: e4f476b4e1304ec98ec24919518966ca832c8403a082ef12b353b590f38d818d # https://minecraft-heads.com/custom-heads/decoration/39494-amethyst-crystals


  # `item`
  #
  # Item to be use for the balloon (as if put on an armor stand's helmet slot)
  # You can append `:` followed by the damage value to apply to the item
  # This will be ignored if `texture-hash` is set
  #
  # See https://helpch.at/docs/1.12.2/org/bukkit/Material.html

  item: WOOL:14  # Red Wool
  item: LEAVES   # Same as LEAVES:0
